    <p>
      PageShot is an experiment
      by <a href="mailto:ibicking@mozilla.com">Ian Bicking</a>.  It
      will take shots of the webpage you are on - creating a static
      and stable version of the page that you can share with anyone.
      The original page can disappear, you can take shots of dynamic
      web applications, you can take shots of sites that require
      authentication or are personalized, and whoever you share with
      will see the page the same way you do.
    </p>

    <p>
      To use this service, download the <a href="pageshot.xpi">Firefox Add On</a>
    </p>

    <p>

      you <b>must have e10s disabled</b>.
