## Pageshot

This is a prototype for a product to create better sharable assets. It uses techniques like copying/freezing the DOM, optionally showing history, allowing inline comments, taking snippets and screenshots.

You can view the site (with a link to install the Add-on) at [pageshotpages.appspot.com](https://pageshotpages.appspot.com)

It is implemented as a Firefox Add-on, using the [Add-on SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK) and a website using Google Appengine.  The addon is in the root, and the website is in `appengine/pageshotpages/`

Blog posts about the concept [are available](http://www.ianbicking.org/tag/product-journal.html).

Planning and ideation is happening in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ianb/pageshot/issues).
